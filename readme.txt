Created within Eclipse Java. To run the jar file please use the command "java -jar LibSystem.jar" within the local directory of the file.

If you want to start without a data set do not have LibData.ser within the same directory, if it is not present you will get an exception printout.
It will create a new one once exited, if not exited via the menus it will not save any changes made to LibData.ser.

User View requires a User ID to be used, there is a pre-added user with the ID 1.
This view allows a User to search for, borrow, or return a document. The User can only borrow books or journals.

Admin View, in this view you can add, remove or list users.

Librarian View, in this view you can add a document and list any borrowed.

This project was made assuming correct input types would be used as suggested by the assignment worksheet.

Saves data in serialized form in file "LibData.ser".
